  - code review of simple Meteor apps
  - Components
** What is Meteor?
*** Open-source platform 
  - not just a backend db tool
  - not just a front-end framework for view rendering
  - it's full stack
    - Node.js server; Mongodb backend; MiniMongo client cache; 
      flexible view templates; Iron:Router; library management; 
      deployment; hot deploys; etc.
  - for building web and mobile apps in JavaScript
  - real time
*** Built to power modern apps with 
  - Rich user interfaces
    - single page apps
    - latency compensation
  - Collaborative, multi-user applications
    - reactive data sources
  - Cross-platform apps; mobile integration with Cordova.
**** It's complete and easy so development is fast
*** What is a modern app?
   Facebook Twitter Gmail
   - Focus on your app's unique features instead of wrangling network
     code
   - client-side smart cache
   - Make Facebook-quality apps without Facebook's resources
*** Old tools don't work for modern apps
   - Modern apps serve data, not html
   - Modern apps shouldn't need a refresh button
   - Moving away from old architecture and its frameworks
   - Rails, Django, PHP, ASP.NET, etc. are difficult 
     to adapt to new model
*** Meteor's cloud/client platform
   - Meteor gives you all the components you need to make modern apps
     work - it's a complete platform, not just a library to solve one,
     or a couple problems
